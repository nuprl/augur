This directory houses unit tests for dynamic taint analysis implementations.

It is separated into three directories, `input`, `output-expected`, and 
`output-actual`.

# Testing process

The testing process works as follows:
1. Tests from the `input` directory are executed and instrumented. Their analysis
   generates 
   [abstract machine instructions](#abstract-machine-instructions) 
   from them, and stores them.
   in `output-actual/<test name>_out.js`.
2. The correctness of the [instructions](#abstract-machine-instructions) is
   checked by comparing `output-actual/<test name>_out.js` to
   `output-expected/<test name>_out.js`.
3. The [abstract machine instructions](#abstract-machine-instructions) are
   executed to compute actual flows between sources and sinks.
4. The actual computed flows are compared to the expected flows as described in
   the test specification file.
   
# Test format specification

## `input`
This directory houses the unit tests themselves. Each unit test is a directory
inside `input`.

### Unit test

Each unit test must provide a test specification in a file named `spec.json`.

#### `spec.json`

The test specification file must be of the form:

```typescript
{
    // The script to execute
    main: string;
    
    // Enable verbose logging
    verbose?: boolean;
    
    // The type of taint tracking to use for this analysis
    tracking?: TrackingType;
    
    // The sources of taint
    sources?: Array<TaintDescription>;
    
    // The sinks for taint
    sinks?: Array<TaintDescription>;
    
    // The sinks you expect taint to flow into
    expectedFlows?: Array<TaintDescription>;
    
    // Code locations at which taint should be sanitized
    sanitizers?: Array<TaintDescription>
}
```

where `TaintDescription` is of the form:

```typescript
// Describing a location in code
// All fields are optional
{
    // The type of JavaScript feature
    type?: TaintType;
    // The name of the feature
    name?: string;
    // The filename where the feature occurs
    fileName: string;
}
```

and `TaintType` is of the form:

```typescript
"function" | "variable" | "builtin" | "expr" | "functionInvocation" 
| "functionReturn" | "literal" | "declaration";
```

and `TrackingType` is of the form:
```typescript
"Boolean" | "SourcedBoolean" | "Expression"
```

## `output-expected`

For each unit test in `tests-unit/input` named `test`, there should be a
corresponding file named `tests-unit/output-expected/test_out.js`, that contains
the expected
[abstract machine instructions](#abstract-machine-instructions).

## `output-actual`

For each unit test in `tests-unit/input` named `test`, a file named
`tests-unit/output-actual/test_out.js` will be generated when the test is
executed. It will contain the actual 
[abstract machine instructions](#abstract-machine-instructions) corresponding to
the test.

## Abstract machine instructions

See [the abstract machine documentation](../ts/src/abstractMachine/).
